# A site that uses Deno + SvelteKit

Welcome! This is a WIP readme.

## Developing

Install dependencies with `pnpm install` (if you think you don't have `pnpm` installed, perhaps you do. Recente (16+) Node versions come with the `corepack` module.. just run `corepack enable` and you'll get `pnpm` ;):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start a development server with:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
